Did you ever been so lazy that you watched your favourite tv show few days later just because you struggled to download it? Now you can be lazy again - your show will be downloaded automatically.
This little tool can check RSS feeds, files on server or IRC channels (using `irssi` log) for new releases and download torrents for them.

## Current state
Project is under development. More details soon.
